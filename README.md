# Theatre-Booking-System
Full stack theatre booking system using PHP, MySQL, JS, HTML & CSS.

I created a website theatre booking system as part of my web-development module coursework for my studies.

The website was built from scratch and has been secured against SQL injections.
You can "book" tickets for a given show at any given time and choose the seat you wish to book, being able to change it before confirming the purchase.
